# Node Health Check
In this section we will be talking about a specific variation of a Node Health Check which was developed by Michael Jennings
as part of the warewulf provisioning project. We will go over some of the basics about why Node Health check scripts are useful. We will then detail how to install the warewulf node health check script on a compute node and how to configure the node health check script. Finally we will show how you can run the node health check with your resource scheduler and as a standalone binary.

These documents are meant to provide a quick start guide to installing and configuring the node health check script. For more detailed
instruction on how to configure the various checks available as part of NHC please refer to the github page for the NHC project at
